In 1985, he received the Turing Award for his research in the theory of algorithms, including the development of the Edmonds–Karp algorithm for solving the maximum flow problem on networks, Hopcroft–Karp algorithm for finding maximum cardinality matchings in bipartite graphs, and his landmark paper in complexity theory called \"Reducibility Among Combinatorial Problems\", in which he proved 21 problems to be NP-complete. This paper was probably the most important catalyst in the explosion of interest in the study of NP-completeness and the P vs NP problem.\n\nSupport this podcast by signing up with these sponsors:\n- Eight Sleep: https://eightsleep.com/lex\n- Cash App - use code \"LexPodcast\" and download:\n- Cash App (App Store): https://apple.co/2sPrUHe\n- Cash App (Google Play): https://bit.ly/2MlvP5w\n\nEPISODE LINKS:\nRichard's wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_M._Karp\n\nPODCAST INFO:\nPodcast website:\nhttps://lexfridman.com/podcast\nApple Podcasts:\nhttps://apple.co/2lwqZIr\nSpotify:\nhttps://spoti.fi/2nEwCF8\nRSS:\nhttps://lexfridman.com/feed/podcast/\nFull episodes playlist:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrAXtmErZgOdP_8GztsuKi9nrraNbKKp4\nClips playlist:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrAXtmErZgOeciFP3CBCIEElOJeitOr41\n\nOUTLINE:\n0:00 - Introduction\n3:50 - Geometry\n9:46 - Visualizing an algorithm\n13:00 - A beautiful algorithm\n18:06 - Don Knuth and geeks\n22:06 - Early days of computers\n25:53 - Turing Test\n30:05 - Consciousness\n33:22 - Combinatorial algorithms\n37:42 - Edmonds-Karp algorithm\n40:22 - Algorithmic complexity\n50:25 - P=NP\n54:25 - NP-Complete problems\n1:10:29 - Proving P=NP\n1:12:57 - Stable marriage problem\n1:20:32 - Randomized algorithms\n1:33:23 - Can a hard problem be easy in practice?\n1:43:57 - Open problems in theoretical computer science\n1:46:21 - A strange idea in complexity theory\n1:50:49 - Machine learning\n1:56:26 - Bioinformatics\n2:00:37 - Memory of Richard's father\n\nCONNECT:\n- Subscribe to this YouTube channel\n- Twitter: https://twitter.com/lexfridman\n- LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/lexfridman\n- Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/LexFridmanPage\n- Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/lexfridman\n- Medium: https://medium.com/@lexfridman\n- Support on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/lexfridman","videoId":"KllCrlfLuzs"},"37":{"title":"Jitendra Malik: Computer Vision | Lex Fridman Podcast #110","publishedAt":"2020-07-21T23:16:49Z","description":"Jitendra Malik is a professor at Berkeley and one of the seminal figures in the field of computer vision, the kind before the deep learning revolution, and the kind after.
