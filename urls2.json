He is the originator and popularizer of a lot of fascinating ideas in evolutionary biology and science in general, including funny enough the introduction of the word meme in his 1976 book The Selfish Gene, which in the context of a gene-centered view of evolution is an exceptionally powerful idea. He is outspoken, bold, and often fearless in his defense of science and reason, and in this way, is one of the most influential thinkers of our time.\n\nPS: There is some occasional noise in the audio, which I tried to clean up in the edit.\n\nSupport this podcast by signing up with these sponsors:\n- Cash App - use code \"LexPodcast\" and download:\n- Cash App (App Store): https://apple.co/2sPrUHe\n- Cash App (Google Play): https://bit.ly/2MlvP5w\n\nEPISODE LINKS:\nRichard's Website: https://www.richarddawkins.net/\nRichard's Twitter: https://twitter.com/RichardDawkins\nRichard's Books:\n- Selfish Gene: https://amzn.to/34tpHQy\n- The Magic of Reality: https://amzn.to/3c0aqZQ\n- The Blind Watchmaker: https://amzn.to/2RqV5tH\n- The God Delusion: https://amzn.to/2JPrxlc\n- Outgrowing God: https://amzn.to/3ebFess\n- The Greatest Show on Earth: https://amzn.to/2Rp2j1h\n\nPODCAST INFO:\nPodcast website:\nhttps://lexfridman.com/podcast\nApple Podcasts:\nhttps://apple.co/2lwqZIr\nSpotify:\nhttps://spoti.fi/2nEwCF8\nRSS:\nhttps://lexfridman.com/feed/podcast/\nFull episodes playlist:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrAXtmErZgOdP_8GztsuKi9nrraNbKKp4\nClips playlist:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrAXtmErZgOeciFP3CBCIEElOJeitOr41\n\nOUTLINE:\n0:00 - Introduction\n2:31 - Intelligent life in the universe\n5:03 - Engineering intelligence (are there shortcuts?)\n7:06 - Is the evolutionary process efficient?\n10:39 - Human brain and AGI\n15:31 - Memes\n26:37 - Does society need religion?\n33:10 - Conspiracy theories\n39:10 - Where do morals come from in humans?\n46:10 - AI began with the ancient wish to forge the gods\n49:18 - Simulation\n56:58 - Books that influenced you\n1:02:53 - Meaning of life\n\nCONNECT:\n- Subscribe to this YouTube channel\n- Twitter: https://twitter.com/lexfridman\n- LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/lexfridman\n- Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/LexFridmanPage\n- Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/lexfridman\n- Medium: https://medium.com/@lexfridman\n- Support on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/lexfridman","videoId":"5f-JlzBuUUU"},"61":{"title":"David Silver: AlphaGo, AlphaZero, and Deep Reinforcement Learning | Lex Fridman Podcast #86","publishedAt":"2020-04-03T21:16:45Z","description":"David Silver leads the reinforcement learning research group at DeepMind and was lead researcher on AlphaGo, AlphaZero and co-lead on AlphaStar, and MuZero and lot of important work in reinforcement learning.\n\nSupport this podcast by signing up with these sponsors:\n- MasterClass: https://masterclass.com/lex\n- Cash App - use code \"LexPodcast\" and download:\n- Cash App (App Store): https://apple.co/2sPrUHe\n- Cash App (Google Play): https://bit.ly/2MlvP5w\n\nEPISODE LINKS:\nReinforcement learning (book): https://amzn.to/2Jwp5zG\n\nPODCAST INFO:\nPodcast website:\nhttps://lexfridman.com/podcast\nApple Podcasts:\nhttps://apple.co/2lwqZIr\nSpotify:\nhttps://spoti.fi/2nEwCF8\nRSS:\nhttps://lexfridman.com/feed/podcast/\nFull episodes playlist:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrAXtmErZgOdP_8GztsuKi9nrraNbKKp4\nClips playlist:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrAXtmErZgOeciFP3CBCIEElOJeitOr41\n\nOUTLINE:\n0:00 - Introduction\n4:09 - First program\n11:11 - AlphaGo\n21:42 - Rule of the game of Go\n25:37 - Reinforcement learning: personal journey\n30:15 - What is reinforcement learning?\n43:51 - AlphaGo (continued)\n53:40 - Supervised learning and self play in AlphaGo\n1:06:12 - Lee Sedol retirement from Go play\n1:08:57 - Garry Kasparov\n1:14:10 - Alpha Zero and self play\n1:31:29 - Creativity in AlphaZero\n1:35:21 - AlphaZero applications\n1:37:59 - Reward functions\n1:40:51 - Meaning of life\n\nCONNECT:\n- Subscribe to this YouTube channel\n- Twitter: https://twitter.com/lexfridman\n- LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/lexfridman\n- Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/LexFridmanPage\n- Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/lexfridman\n- Medium: https://medium.com/@lexfridman\n- Support on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/lexfridman","videoId":"uPUEq8d73JI"},"62":{"title":"Roger Penrose: Physics of Consciousness and the Infinite Universe | Lex Fridman Podcast #85","publishedAt":"2020-03-31T14:34:13Z","description":"Roger Penrose is physicist, mathematician, and philosopher at University of Oxford.

I gave away almost all my stuff in the name of minimalism a couple of times, and he survived all of that. There's a longer story there. If you're curious, ask me and I'll do one of the AMA videos about Hedgy. In general, people asked to put more stuff in the scene. I don't have much stuff.

She co-wrote the 1980 science documentary series Cosmos hosted by Carl Sagan, whom she married in 1981, and her love for whom, with the help of NASA, was recorded as brain waves on a golden record along with other things our civilization has to offer and launched into space on the Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 spacecraft that are now, 42 years later, still active, reaching out farther into deep space than any human-made object ever has. This was a profound and beautiful decision she made as a Creative Director of NASA's Voyager Interstellar Message Project. In 2014, she went on to create the second season of Cosmos, called Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey, and in 2020, the new third season called Cosmos: Possible Worlds, which is being released this upcoming Monday, March 9.
