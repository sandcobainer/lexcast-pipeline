He jumped out at me because he seemed to be deep in thought and bothered by something profound, in stark contrast to other stuffed animals that usually have an aloof, empty smile on their face. I gave away almost all my stuff in the name of minimalism a couple of times, and he survived all of that. There's a longer story there. If you're curious, ask me and I'll do one of the AMA videos about Hedgy. In general, people asked to put more stuff in the scene. I don't have much stuff.

She co-wrote the 1980 science documentary series Cosmos hosted by Carl Sagan, whom she married in 1981, and her love for whom, with the help of NASA, was recorded as brain waves on a golden record along with other things our civilization has to offer and launched into space on the Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 spacecraft that are now, 42 years later, still active, reaching out farther into deep space than any human-made object ever has. This was a profound and beautiful decision she made as a Creative Director of NASA's Voyager Interstellar Message Project. In 2014, she went on to create the second season of Cosmos, called Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey, and in 2020, the new third season called Cosmos: Possible Worlds, which is being released this upcoming Monday, March 9.
